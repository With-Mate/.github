## withmate

 WithMate is a 'journey record' site that allows you to focus on
what you feel and learn in the 'process' of progressing your goals.
It differs from the goal management app on the market, which
focuses on whether or not the goal is successful, and how much
time the goal has been done for a long time.
These are the two values of our service.
Number one: Finding your own pace without comparing it to others.
Number two: emphasizing the value of the journey, not success
and failure, which is contrary to the dichotomous thinking
that focuses only on the outcome.
WithMate supports your journey towards achieving goals and creates
valuable records with your mate.
Share the value of the journey, convey positive inspiration,
and WithMate will make your journey more meaningful.
Record and share your journey together with WithMate!
